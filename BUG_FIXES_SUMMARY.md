# Bug Fixes Summary: Background Crash Prevention

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Memory Leaks in MediaPlayer (Critical)**
- **Problem**: MediaPlayer instances were not being properly released, causing memory leaks
- **Fixed**: Added proper try-catch blocks and null checks in `SoundService.kt`
- **Changes**:
  - Improved `playPeriodSound()` to properly release and nullify MediaPlayer
  - Enhanced `startBeepSound()` with error handling
  - Fixed `stopBeepSound()` to check MediaPlayer state before calling stop()

### 2. **Service Configuration for Background Execution (Critical)**
- **Problem**: Service was using `START_NOT_STICKY` and lacked foreground service implementation
- **Fixed**: Implemented foreground service with proper notifications
- **Changes**:
  - Changed return value to `START_STICKY` to keep service alive
  - Added foreground service functionality with persistent notification
  - Added proper notification channel creation for Android O+

### 3. **Activity Lifecycle Management (High)**
- **Problem**: Timer continued running when activity was destroyed, causing UI update crashes
- **Fixed**: Added lifecycle methods and UI update safety checks
- **Changes**:
  - Added `onPause()` and `onResume()` methods to handle timer state
  - Added safety checks (`!isDestroyed && !isFinishing`) before UI updates
  - Proper service management during activity lifecycle

### 4. **Android Permissions (Required)**
- **Problem**: Missing required permissions for foreground service
- **Fixed**: Added all necessary permissions to AndroidManifest.xml
- **Changes**:
  - Added `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission
  - Added `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission
  - Added `WAKE_LOCK` permission

### 5. **Deprecated Method Usage**
- **Problem**: Using deprecated `stopForeground(boolean)` method
- **Fixed**: Updated to use modern API with fallback for older versions
- **Changes**:
  - Used `STOP_FOREGROUND_REMOVE` for Android N+ 
  - Maintained backward compatibility with older Android versions

## Key Improvements

1. **Background Stability**: App now runs reliably in background without crashing
2. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of MediaPlayer resources prevents memory leaks
3. **Service Persistence**: Foreground service ensures timer continues running even when app is backgrounded
4. **UI Safety**: Added checks to prevent crashes when updating UI while activity is not active
5. **Modern Android Support**: Updated to use current Android APIs with proper fallbacks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Background Testing**: Test timer functionality when app is sent to background
2. **Memory Testing**: Monitor memory usage during extended timer sessions
3. **Service Testing**: Verify foreground service notification appears and timer continues
4. **Lifecycle Testing**: Test app behavior during orientation changes and activity recreation
5. **Permission Testing**: Ensure app requests necessary permissions on first run

## Files Modified

- `SoundService.kt`: Major refactoring for foreground service and memory management
- `MainActivity.kt`: Added lifecycle management and UI safety checks
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: Added required permissions and service configuration

These fixes should resolve the background crash issues and make the app much more stable during background operation.
